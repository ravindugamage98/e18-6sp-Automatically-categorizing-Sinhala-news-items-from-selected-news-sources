## Introduction
* In the modern world, with the abundance of information available on the internet, it has become challenging to filter out relevant information from a vast amount of data.
* Sinhala is the primary language spoken in Sri Lanka, and many online news
sources publish news articles in Sinhala.
* With the increasing demand for relevant news, it is necessary to categorize the
Sinhala news items from different news sources automatically.
* Automated text classification is a great option for this. It is the process of using machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to
automatically categorize text documents into predefined categories or classes.

## Problem
The primary problem addressed by this project is the lack of tools available for
automatically categorizing Sinhala news articles. This creates a challenge for readers to find relevant articles quickly and for news organizations to effectively manage their content.

## Aim
The aim of this project is to develop an automated system that categorizes Sinhala
news items based on their content to make it easier for readers to find relevant
articles quickly and for news organizations to effectively manage their content.

## Objectives
* To collect a dataset of Sinhala news articles from selected news sources.
* To preprocess and clean the data to prepare it for analysis.
* To develop a machine learning model that can accurately categorize news articles.
* To evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics.
* To deploy the model as a web application to make it accessible to users.

## Proposed solution
* The proposed solution is to use machine learning algorithms to categorize Sinhalanews items.
* The system will be trained using a dataset of manually categorized Sinhala news items.
* The system will use natural language processing techniques to extract the relevant features from the news items
* Use machine learning algorithms to categorize the news items.

Impact/Business Value:
* Reduce the time and resources spent on categorization process
* Improve consistency of categorization process

Success Measurements:
* Accuracy of the model on test dataset
* Reduction in time and resources spent on categorization process

User Stories/Use Case Scenarios:
* Journalists can use the tool to categorize news items quickly and accurately
* News agencies can use the tool to automate their categorization process and save resources
* When a news reader wants to view news items in a specific category.
